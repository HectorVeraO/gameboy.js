# In progress educational GameBoy emulator


# TODO
- Implement PPU
- Implement rendering (using HTML Canvas)
- Count T and M states (are M states the same as instruction cycles?)
- Wire up PPU, CPU, Cartridge using the System class (maybe abstract away memory access using a memory management unit MMU)
