/**
 * Expected hexadecimal dump by the built-in boot ROM sequence.
 * 
 * The pixels are encoded as follows:
 * - Bytes 0x04...0x1B encode the top half of the logo
 * - Bytes 0x1C...0x33 encode the bottom half of the logo
 * - For each half (top and bottom), each nibble encodes 4 pixels (the MSB corresponds to the leftmost,
 *   the LSB to the rightmost); a pixel is lit if the corresponding bit is set.
 * - The 4-pixel "groups" are laid out top to bottom left to right
 * - The monochrome models upscale the entire thing by a factor of 2 (leading to somewhat chunky pixels)
